Hey internet! This is Sean, just another college student who is taking up blogging (about science, astrophysics, projects, and interests) to have something to say about some things.

I won't be very active, I'm afraid, but this site will be a great way for me to keep myself accountable for side-projects and interests and share said things with commentary and code and other cool stuff.

This blog will be a completely Jekyll + Github Pages static site, while the main site (chuxiaocao.com, or whatever it might be in the future) will be dynamic with whatever foo framework I have time to play with. This is in part due to personal frustrations with other blogging platforms and their opaqueness, and also a desire for minimalism and content. Having a blog be a repository is also a fascinating idea, because the time-evolution of the site is exposed with no exceptions (such as deleted/hidden/edited posts, as long as the conventional rules of git are followed.)

I'm still testing this out to see how it'll work out, but I'm really excited for the possibilities of this platform!
